Every project I start, starts with the problem of facing an empty canvas. That blank white screens that stare at me.

Thousands of thoughts run through my head,

- How will the end design look like?
- How will people react to it when they see it?
- Will it be good enough to post on Dribbble?
- What if no one understands it?

While these are important questions to ask, these are the dialogues that will stop you from completing anything.

Ask these questions at the end.

**Always be stupid and just start your work without thinking.** You will always have time to improve anything.

For me, adding the first object is the hardest part.

My advice for beginners and to myself is to start with something, **add the first stroke**, add the first text, add the first rectangle. Then, slowly, you go into a flow state where you forget about the difficulty of the situation and just get things done.

You should face adversity head-on and you will always find that it is 10x times easier than you imagined.

> "Many painters are afraid of the blank canvas, but the blank canvas is afraid of the truly passionate painter who dares-and who has once broken the spell of 'you can't.'" ~ Vincent Van Gogh
