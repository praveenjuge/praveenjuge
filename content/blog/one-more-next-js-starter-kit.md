description: 'There are, quite literally, a thousand starter kits for Next.js, with next-create-app being the top choice for many. However, when I embark on a new project, I prefer to start with as few files as possible. This approach helps me kick off new projects quickly and without any unnecessary clutter.'

So, I've created a Next.js starter kit tailored for myself, which you can check out [here](https://github.com/praveenjuge/nextjs-minimal-starter).

This kit contains just 5 files but comes packed with everything you need right out of the box:

- React
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Prettier
- ESLint
- Geist Font

When starting a new project, I either duplicate this template or simply copy and paste the 5 files. This method saves me the hassle of removing unwanted code from other starter kits and ensures Prettier and ESLint are configured exactly to my liking.
