#### **1. [Kill Process](https://www.raycast.com/rolandleth/kill-process)**

Think of this as your go-to replacement for Activity Monitor. Kill Process displays all running processes, allowing you to terminate them with ease. It’s particularly handy if, like me, you're still on an Intel Mac and have to deal with power-hungry apps like Chromium, Figma, or VS Code. This extension saves me a ton of time by letting me quickly close down processes that are slowing down my system.

#### **2. [Ulysses](https://www.raycast.com/praveenjuge/ulysses)**

As someone who does a lot of writing, Ulysses is my writing app of choice. This Raycast extension lets me open Ulysses, create new documents, and access my notes without breaking my flow. I created this extension to fit my workflow, and I’m currently working on updates to make it even more functional.

#### **3. [MynaUI Icons](https://www.raycast.com/praveenjuge/mynaui-icons)**

This is another extension I created, designed to work with my MynaUI Icons pack. It’s perfect for quickly searching and copying icons that I use across various platforms like Canva, Figma, and VS Code. Whether I’m working on design projects or writing code, having these icons readily available is a lifesaver.

#### **4. [Coffee](https://www.raycast.com/mooxl/coffee)**

Coffee is a nifty little extension that prevents your Mac from going to sleep while you're on a call. It sits in the menu bar, and you can toggle it on whenever you need to keep your mic active. It’s a simple but effective tool, especially during those long online meetings.

#### **5. [Reminders](https://www.raycast.com/raycast/apple-reminders) and [Apple Notes](https://www.raycast.com/raycast/apple-notes)**

These two extensions are must-haves if you’re embedded in the Apple ecosystem. The Reminders extension is a powerful tool for managing tasks, and the Apple Notes extension is perfect for quickly jotting down ideas. I often start my notes in Apple Notes and later transfer them to Ulysses if they’re worth expanding on.

#### **6. [Color Picker](https://www.raycast.com/thomas/color-picker)**

If you work with design tools outside of Figma, the Color Picker extension is a must. I use it frequently in Canva and DaVinci Resolve to grab and use specific colors on the fly. It’s one of those small utilities that makes a big difference in my day-to-day work.

#### Honorable Mentions

- [**Linear Extension**](https://www.raycast.com/linear/linear): Great for managing tasks in Linear.
- **Clipboard History**: An absolute must for managing copied text.
- [**Change Case Extension**](https://www.raycast.com/erics118/change-case): Quickly change the case of any text—very handy for coding or writing.
