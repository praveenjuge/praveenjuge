[WebKit](https://webkit.org/blog/15269/help-us-invent-masonry-layouts-for-css-grid-level-3/) is working on adding masonry layouts to CSS Grid. This means we might soon get to create these layouts easily without needing JavaScript or tricky CSS.

[Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/masonry) is showing off how `display: masonry` works, and it’s pretty slick. It lets us manage content of different sizes in a grid without any ugly gaps. This could make building attractive and dynamic websites a lot easier. No more wrestling with the grid system to get things to line up right!

I can't wait until `display: masonry` is something we can all use. It’s going to change how we design frontends by saving us a ton of time and letting us get more creative without fussing over layout issues.

It’d be even cooler if CSS could automatically figure out the best number of columns for a masonry layout by looking at the space and content size. That would make our designs adapt smoothly to different screens, making websites look awesome everywhere without extra work.
