description: Recently, I stumbled upon OpenCommit, a package that generates
  commit messages based on the files changed with GPT. Now, my skin is clearer,
  I walk with a brisk step, and I appreciate nature more. If this is what AI
  does for us, I'll welcome it with open hands.

My commit messages last week:

My commit messages now:

I've always admired how other people in popular open source projects and some of my peers take the time to write detailed commit messages and PR requests. In the past, I would often be impatient and write something quickly just to get it out of the way.

After transitioning to design full-time from development, the rare commits I make to my websites still don't have any meaningful commit messages, which I didn't mind until I had to go back to find something in the wall of commits.

But [opencommit](https://github.com/di-sukharev/opencommit) changed all that. As soon as I saw it, I went to OpenAI, got an API key, and tried it out. I have to say, I love the result! As you can see in the image above, it generates perfect commit messages, and I love it.

That's enough of me raving about it - try it out for yourself -> [github.com/di-sukharev/opencommit](https://github.com/di-sukharev/opencommit).
