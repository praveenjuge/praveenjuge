You know how we all enjoy watching those mesmerizing speed drawing and speed art videos on YouTube, right? I mean, who doesn't love seeing a blank canvas transform into a stunning piece of art in just a matter of minutes?

Well, I noticed that there wasn't much content like that for Figma designs, and being a designer myself, I decided to do something about it. So, guess what? I've started uploading my very own Figma speedrun videos!

I've already added 4 videos to my channel, and I promise there are more to come! I'd really appreciate it if you could check them out and let me know what you think. Are they good? Do they inspire you to create your own designs? And most importantly, is there anything else design-related you'd like to see on the channel? I'm open to all your suggestions and ideas!

Here's the link to my YouTube channel: <https://www.youtube.com/@praveenjuge>

LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE, or I will be slightly disappointed.

P.S: I don't design that fast; all videos are 2x sped up.
